      <h1>Get to know me!</h1>

    <p>Who am i you say? Well i am a 3rd year student of Pamantasan ng Cabuyao, currently taking the course BSCS.</p>
    <p>Its a course i had fun but at the same time felt disappointment, not to the course itself</p>
    <p>However, the joy i felt when things worked out overshadowed the sadness i felt.</p> <br /><br />


    <p>I mostly do arts as a hobby, had great portraits that i am proud of. However, why did i took BSCS as my course instead of something that is related to arts? </p>
    <p>Well, its mostly because i enjoyed it as much as i do arts. While creating a website its fun to see the improvements i made little by little just like when i draw. </p>
    <p>It is also enjoyable to see that the program works especially when i worked on it for hours.</p> <br /><br />

    <p>Which is why i think creating beautiful website is the same as creating beautiful art but through Html, PHP, CSS and Java </p>
    <p>My works weren't as beautiful like what others do, but i do think with more effort and practice i will reach their level little by little</p>
    <p>maybe not now but soon!</p>
